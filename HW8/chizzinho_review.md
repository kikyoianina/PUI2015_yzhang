## Review on the plot of chizzinho

###CLARITY: 
Overall the plot looks clear and easy to read. The one thing that I didn't get is the point-representations of the spending in us$.  

###ESTHETIC: 
The colors chosen look perfect. 

###HONESTY: 
The plot honestly reproduces the data.

###SUGGESTIONS: 
The labels for the lines of Asia and Europe are too close, making it difficult to clearly distinguish which one is which. It would be better if the labels are listed in a legend.
