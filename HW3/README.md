Solutions for assignment 1 and assignment 2 are stored in HW3_1 and HW3_2 separately.

For assignment 1, I generated 100 random samples for each of the six different distributions (Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Chi-squared, Geometric, and Logistic), all using 100 as the population mean. Scatter plots of sample means versus sample sizes were generated for all 6 distributions. Histogram of all 600 sample means was plotted.

For assignment 2, I run a z-test for data in row 4 in the original table and a chi-square test for data in row 6.
